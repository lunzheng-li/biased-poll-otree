# biased-poll-otree

This repo contains the oTree source code for experiments in the following paper:

**A. Boukouras, W. Jennings, L. Li, Z. Maniadis,"Can Biased Polls Distort Electoral Results? Evidence from the Lab." _European Journal of Political Economy_, forthcoming.**

- For further details, please find the working paper version [here](https://github.com/lunzheng-li/MyWebsite/blob/main/pdf/BJLM2022_Biased%20polls.pdf).

## Notes
- The experiments was conducted in 2018 and 2019, and thus application runs on a very old version of otree (see `requirements_base.txt`). Please check the oTree documentation [here](https://www.otree.org/blog/install-old-version.html) on _**"How to install an old version of oTree"**_.
- Tested environment: `otree==2.1.35`,`python==3.7.16`
